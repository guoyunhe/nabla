This directory contains various modules supported by Nabla kit.

Every folder contains a module's circuit design scheme and Arduino code. The "meta" folder is a template for all modules, which help people to create their own electronic modules capitable with Nabla kit and enrich it.

We hope you to create more than we offered, and share them with others.
